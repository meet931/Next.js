                Route group is used to group the routes. It is useful when we have multiple routes to be grouped together. <br /><br />
                Route Group can be achieved by converting &quot;auth&quot; folder to &quot;(auth)&quot; in src/app/(auth)
            </pre>
            
        </div>
